        <h3>Botanical Features</h3>
        <p>
        
        Sunflowers belong to the family <span class="line">Asteraceae</span> and are native to North and Central America. <br> These annual plants can reach impressive heights, with some varieties growing up to 12 feet tall. <br> Their bright yellow petals surround a central disk made up of numerous tiny flowers. <br> Sunflowers exhibit a unique behavior called heliotropism, in which their flower heads track the movement of the sun throughout the day, facing east in the morning and gradually turning westward as the day progresses. </p></li></div>

         <h3>Ecological Significance</h3>
         <p>
        Sunflowers play a vital role in various ecosystems. They are pollinator magnets, attracting bees, <span class="fly">butterflies</span>, and other insects with their nectar and abundant pollen. The numerous tiny flowers on the central disk provide ample feeding opportunities for these pollinators. Sunflower seeds are a valuable food source for birds and small mammals, contributing to local biodiversity. Additionally, their extensive root systems help improve soil structure and nutrient cycling.
